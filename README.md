# About

This project is an analysis of plane crashes since 1918. There is only one question for which we seek an answer: How safe are the flights we all choose?

# Summary

Looking at our analysis and visualizations, we can uncover the following solutions: When we focus on the biggest accident causes, the human factor, technical reasons and weather events pushed the planes to crash.


Human Factor:


This is the most serious incident that can happen to our scheduled flights. There may be more than one reason why accidents are caused by the human factor.

However, after a little research we learned that the biggest cause of human-related plane crashes is that many airlines put pressure on the flight crew and air traffic controllers make them work intensively. Thus, we come across tired pilots and air traffic controllers. This puts both the safety of the flight crew and the safety of the passengers at risk. In fact, although the scheduled flights we all prefer are quite safe, this attitude of the airline companies puts the flight safety at risk and raises the question of how safe the planes are.

Another pilot mistake we should mention is the egoistic behavior of the captain pilots on the co-pilots and cabin crew. Some captain pilots, who jeopardize flight safety, try to make their own mistakes right by putting pressure on the flight crew. This is just like the pressure that airline companies put on flight crew.

Another human factor we should mention is the passengers. Disruptive passengers put the cabin crew at risk and again put flight safety at risk.


Technical failures and weather conditions:


I would like to deal with accidents that occur due to technical reasons and weather conditions together. Because I think that the causes of these accidents are entirely due to the old generation aircraft. In particular, we can count the aircraft produced after 1990 as a new generation. When we look at the visualizations in our analysis, it is almost very low for aircraft produced after 1990 to crash due to these two factors. After the model year I mentioned, the accidents that occur for these reasons decrease to single digits. In this way, we can consider the next generation aircraft as safe for technical reasons and weather conditions.
